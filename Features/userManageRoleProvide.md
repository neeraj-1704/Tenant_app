In a **multi-tenant app**, the term **“manage users”** in the context of **user registration** typically means:

---

## 🔐 What “Manage Users” Means

It refers to the **ability to perform CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on **users within a tenant**.

> ✅ **Only certain roles (like `admin`) should be allowed to manage users.**

## ✅ Typical Actions for “Manage Users”

| Action              | Description                                         | Example Endpoint                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Create user**     | Add a new user to your team                         | `POST /api/users`                 |
| **Read users**      | View all users in your tenant                       | `GET /api/users`                  |
| **Update user**     | Change user role, status, name, etc.                | `PUT /api/users/:id`              |
| **Delete user**     | Remove a user from the tenant                       | `DELETE /api/users/:id`           |
| **Assign roles**    | Grant `sales`, `support`, or `admin` role to a user | Done via `PUT` or in registration |
| **Deactivate user** | Change status to `inactive` so they can’t log in    | `PATCH /api/users/:id/status`     |

## 🧭 Who Can “Manage Users”?

Usually only users with the **`admin` role**.

That's where **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) comes in.

```ts
// Example RBAC check
requirePermission("manage:users")
```

---

## 🧱 Backend Logic for “Manage Users” Feature

Let’s say an **admin** creates a new user for their team.

### 🔄 Flow:

```
POST /api/users
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Body:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@abc.com",
  "role": "sales",
  "password": "secure123"
}
↓
Zod Validation
↓
RBAC Middleware: check if user has "manage:users"
↓
Check if email already exists in the tenant
↓
Hash password, save user with tenantId
↓
Respond with success
```

## 🏢 Example Scenario

You're an **admin of Tenant A**, and you want to onboard your team:

1. You register your tenant (`/api/tenants`)
2. You register yourself as `admin` (`/api/users/register`)
3. You login and get a JWT (`/api/users/login`)
4. You use your token to:

   * Add more users (sales/support) to your team
   * Update their roles or deactivate them
   * View a paginated list of users in your org

## ✅ In Summary

| Term           | Meaning                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Manage users` | Perform CRUD on tenant users                |
| Admin only     | Only roles with `manage:users` permission   |
| Includes       | Create, update, delete, assign roles/status |
