Great question!

In a **multi-tenant application**, the terms **User** and **Customer** usually represent **different roles or data models** depending on your app's architecture and domain.

## 🔍 Difference Between `User` and `Customer`

| 🔑 Concept         | `User`                                                             | `Customer`                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Someone who logs into and uses the application                     | Someone who is managed *within* the application               |
| **Represents**     | A **staff member**, **admin**, or **agent** working for a tenant   | A **client**, **lead**, or **contact** managed by the tenant  |
| **Authentication** | ✅ Yes — they have login credentials (email/password, token)        | ❌ No — usually not authenticated                              |
| **Belongs to**     | A **Tenant** (organization that uses your app)                     | A **Tenant**, but they are *not users* of the app             |
| **Role**           | `admin`, `sales`, `support`, etc. (defined roles for internal ops) | Usually no roles — they're the subject of business activities |
| **Example**        | Salesperson or admin at a CRM company using your app               | The customer whose info is tracked in the CRM                 |

### 🏢 Use Case in a SaaS CRM Example

Suppose you're building a **CRM** SaaS for multiple companies.

#### `Tenant`

* Represents a company using your CRM (e.g., **"ABC Corp"**)

#### `User`

* Alice (admin at ABC Corp)
* Bob (salesperson at ABC Corp)
* These people log in, manage leads, tasks, and customers

#### `Customer`

* John Doe (a client of ABC Corp)
* Jane Smith (a potential lead for ABC Corp)
* These people are entered and tracked *by* your users

In multi-tenant applications:

* `User` usually has fields like `email`, `password`, `role`, `tenantId`
* `Customer` has fields like `name`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `tenantId`

Let me know if you want help modeling these in your database or separating permissions between them (like RBAC).
