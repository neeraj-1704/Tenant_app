**Rate limiting** in a backend application is a technique used to **control how many requests a user or client can make to your API within a certain time frame** (e.g., 100 requests per minute). It helps prevent:

* **Abuse or misuse** of the API (e.g., brute-force attacks)
* **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks
* **Resource overuse**, protecting the server
* **Fair usage** across multiple clients

### ✅ Example Use Case in a Multi-Tenant Backend

Imagine a CRM where:

* A free-tier tenant can only make 1000 API calls per day.
* A paid-tier tenant can make 100,000.

You can apply **rate limiting per tenant or per user** to enforce those limits.

### 🧰 Common Rate Limiting Strategies

| Strategy           | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Window**   | Limits requests in fixed time windows (e.g., 100/minute)               |
| **Sliding Window** | More accurate, uses moving time windows to count requests              |
| **Token Bucket**   | Clients have tokens that refill over time; each request uses one token |
| **Leaky Bucket**   | Controls request burstiness; processes at a fixed rate                 |

### ⚙️ How to Implement Rate Limiting in Node.js

#### 🛠 With `express-rate-limit` (easy & popular)

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

```ts
// middleware/rateLimit.ts
import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

export const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later.",
});
```

```ts
// in your app.ts or index.ts
import { apiLimiter } from "./middleware/rateLimit";

app.use("/api/", apiLimiter); // Apply to all API routes
```

---

### 🔐 Advanced: Per-Tenant Rate Limiting

To enforce different limits for different tenants, you can use a **custom middleware** and store usage counts in Redis.

Example idea (pseudo-code):

```ts
// For each request:
const tenantId = req.user.tenantId;
const key = `rate:${tenantId}`;

// Use Redis to increment and expire the key based on windowMs
```

Libraries like **`rate-limiter-flexible`** are excellent for this:

```bash
npm install rate-limiter-flexible ioredis
```

---

### 🧠 Best Practices

* Apply rate limiting at **entry points** (e.g., API gateway, Express).
* **Whitelist** internal systems or admin endpoints.
* Use **Redis** for distributed rate limiting in scaled environments.
* Give clients **feedback via headers** (`Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`).
